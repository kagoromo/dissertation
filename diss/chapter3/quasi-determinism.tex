\section{Proof of quasi-determinism for $\lambdaLVish$}\label{s:quasi-quasi-determinism}

In this section, I give a proof of quasi-determinism for
$\lambdaLVish$ that formalizes the claim made earlier in this chapter:
that, for a given program, although some executions may raise
exceptions, all executions that produce a final result will produce
the same final result.

The quasi-determinism theorem says that if two executions starting
from a configuration $\conf$ terminate in configurations $\conf'$ and
$\conf''$, then either $\conf'$ and $\conf''$ are the same
configuration, or one of them is $\error$.  As with the determinism
result for $\lambdaLVar$, quasi-determinism follows from a series of
supporting lemmas which I first prove.}

\subsection{Monotonicity lemma}\label{subsection:quasi-monotonicity}

The Monotonicity lemma says that, as evaluation proceeds according to
the $\parstepsto$ relation, the store can only grow with respect to
the $\leqstore{}{}$ ordering.

\LemMonotonicity
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the derivation of $\config{S}{e} \parstepsto
  \config{S'}{e'}$, by cases on the last rule in the derivation; see
  Section~\ref{section:monotonicity-proof}.
\end{proof}
 
\TODO{Fill in the rest of this section.}
