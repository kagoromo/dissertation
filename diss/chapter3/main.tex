\chapter{Quasi-Deterministic and Event-Driven Programming with LVars\label{ch:quasi}} % 3

\TODO{Finish editing this chapter.}

\lk{I'm unhappy with the organization of this chapter and the next
  one.  I wanted to separate everything having to do with the Haskell
  library out into its own chapter, but I'm realizing that they are
  pretty heavily mixed together.  So maybe I should talk about the
  Haskell library up front in this chapter, and then let chapter 4 be
  about library internals.}
