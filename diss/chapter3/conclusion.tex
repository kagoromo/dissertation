\section{Conclusion}

\lk{blah blah blah.  This could be made more interesting?...}

We have presented LVish, an extension to the LVars programming model
that provides, first, the ability to \emph{freeze} an LVar and observe
its exact contents, and second, the ability to attach event
handlers to an LVar that respond to state changes.  We have shown that
the resulting extended programming model is \emph{quasi-deterministic}, in
which programs always either evaluate to the same answer or raise an
exception.  Finally, we have provided an implementation of LVish as
a Haskell library, and our $k$-CFA case study demonstrates how our library enables
an expressive and useful style of programming that yields promising parallel speedup.

\lk{TODO: mention future work?  something about footnote 14?  a richer
  menu of choices in Data.LVar.*?  pursue the relationship between
  LVars and CRDTs?}
