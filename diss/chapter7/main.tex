\lk{THe following text is from the FHPC paper conclusion.}

As single-assignment languages and Kahn process networks demonstrate,
monotonicity serves as the foundation of deterministic parallelism.
Taking monotonicity as a starting point, the LVars model generalizes
single assignment to monotonic multiple assignment parameterized by an
application-specific lattice.  Combining monotonic writes with
threshold reads yields a provably deterministic shared-state parallel
programming model that generalizes and unifies a class of languages
suitable for asynchronous parallel applications.

\TODO{Dump in conclusion material from other papers.}
