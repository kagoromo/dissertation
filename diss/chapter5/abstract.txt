Convergent replicated data types, or CvRDTs, are lattice-based data
structures for enforcing the eventual consistency of replicated
objects in a distributed system.  Although CvRDTs are provably
eventually consistent, queries of CvRDTs nevertheless allow
inconsistent intermediate states of replicas to be observed; and
although in practice, many systems allow a mix of eventually consistent and
strongly consistent queries, CvRDTs only support the former.  Taking
inspiration from our previous work on LVars for deterministic parallel
programming, we show how to extend CvRDTs to support deterministic,
strongly consistent queries using a mechanism called threshold
queries.  The threshold query technique generalizes to any lattice,
and hence any CvRDT, and allows deterministic observations to be made
of replicated objects before the replicas' states have converged.
