\begin{proof}
Consider replica $i$ of a threshold CvRDT $(S, \leq, s^0, q, t, u,
m)$.  Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a threshold set with respect to
$(S, \leq)$.  Consider a method execution $t^{k+1}_i(\mathcal{S})$
(\ie, a threshold query that is the $k+1$th method execution
on replica $i$, with threshold set $\mathcal{S}$ as its argument) that
returns some set of activation states $S_a \in \mathcal{S}$.

For part~\ref{thm:this-replica} of the theorem, we have to show that
threshold queries with $\mathcal{S}$ as their argument will always
return $S_a$ on subsequent executions at $i$.  That is, we have to
show that, for all $k' > (k+1)$, the threshold query
$t^{k'}_i(\mathcal{S})$ on $i$ returns $S_a$.

Since $t^{k+1}_i(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$, from
Definition~\ref{def:cvrdt-with-threshold-queries} we have that for
some activation state $s_a \in S_a$, the condition $s_a \leq s^k_i$
holds.  Consider arbitrary $k' > (k+1)$.  Since state is inflationary
across updates, we know that the state $s^{k'}_i$ after method
execution $k'$ is at least $s^k_i$.  That is, $s^k_i \leq s^{k'}_i$.
By transitivity of $\leq$, then, $s_a \leq s^{k'}_i$.  Hence, by
Definition~\ref{def:cvrdt-with-threshold-queries},
$t^{k'}_i(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$.

For part~\ref{thm:any-replica} of the theorem, consider some replica
$j$ of $(S, \leq, s^0, q, t, u, m)$, located at process $p_j$.  We are
required to show that, for all $x \geq 0$, the threshold query
$t^{x+1}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$ eventually, and blocks until it
does.\footnote{The occurrences of $k+1$ and $x+1$ in this proof are an
  artifact of how we index method executions starting from $1$, but
  states starting from $0$.  The initial state (of every replica) is
  $s^0$, and so $s^k_i$ is the state of replica $i$ after method
  execution $k$ has completed at $i$.}
That is, we must show that, for all $x \geq 0$, there exists some
finite $n \geq 0$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item 
for all $i$ in the range $0 \leq i \leq n-1$, the threshold query
$t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns $\block$, and
\item
for all $i \geq n$, the threshold query $t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$
returns $S_a$.
\end{itemize}
Consider arbitrary $x \geq 0$.  Recall that $s^x_j$ is the state of
replica $j$ after the $x$th method execution, and therefore $s^x_j$ is
also the state of $j$ when $t^{x+1}_j(\mathcal{S})$ runs.
%
We have three cases to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item $s^k_i \leq s^x_j$.
(That is, replica $i$'s state after the $k$th method execution on $i$
is \emph{at or below} replica $j$'s state after the $x$th method
execution on $j$.)
%
Choose $n = 0$.  We have to show that, for all $i \geq n$, the
threshold query $t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$.  Since
$t^{k+1}_i(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$, we know that there exists an
$s_a \in S_a$ such that $s_a \leq s^k_i$.  Since $s^k_i \leq s^x_j$,
we have by transitivity of $\leq$ that $s_a \leq s^x_j$.  Therefore,
by Definition~\ref{def:cvrdt-with-threshold-queries},
$t^{x+1}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$.  Then, by
part~\ref{thm:this-replica} of the theorem, we have that subsequent
executions $t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$ at replica $j$ will also return
$S_a$, and so the case holds.  (Note that this case includes the
possibility $s^k_i \equiv s^0$, in which no updates have executed at
replica $i$.)

\item $s^k_i > s^x_j$.
(That is, replica $i$'s state after the $k$th method execution on $i$
is \emph{above} replica $j$'s state after the $x$th method execution
on $j$.)

  We have two subcases:

\begin{itemize}
\item
There exists some activation state $s'_a \in S_a$ for which $s'_a \leq
s^x_j$.  In this case, we choose $n = 0$.  We have to show that, for
all $i \geq n$, the threshold query $t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns
$S_a$.  Since $s'_a \leq s^x_j$, by
Definition~\ref{def:cvrdt-with-threshold-queries},
$t^{x+1}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$.  Then, by
part~\ref{thm:this-replica} of the theorem, we have that subsequent
executions $t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$ at replica $j$ will also return
$S_a$, and so the case holds.

\item
There is no activation state $s'_a \in S_a$ for which $s'_a \leq
s^x_j$.  Since $t^{k+1}_i(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$, we know that
there is some update $u^{k'}_i(a)$ in $i$'s causal history, for some
$k' < (k+1)$, that updates $i$ from a state at or below $s^x_j$ to
$s^k_i$.\footnote{We know that $i$'s state was once at or below
$s^x_j$, because $i$ and $j$ started at the same state $s^0$ and can
both only grow.  Hence the least that $s^x_j$ can be is $s^0$, and we
know that $i$ was originally $s^0$ as well.} By eventual delivery,
$u^{k'}_i(a)$ is eventually delivered at $j$.  Hence some update or
updates that will increase $j$'s state from $s^x_j$ to a state at or
above some $s'_a$ must reach replica $j$.\footnote{We say ``some
update or updates'' because the exact update $u^{k'}_i(a)$ may not be
the update that causes the threshold query at $j$ to unblock; a
different update or updates could do it.  Nevertheless, the existence
of $u^{k'}_i(a)$ means that there is at least one update that will
suffice to unblock the threshold query.}

Let the $x+1+r$th method execution on $j$ be the first update on $j$
that updates its state to some $s^{x+1+r}_j \geq s'_a$, for some
activation state $s'_a \in S_a$.  Choose $n = r+1$.  We have to show that, for
all $i$ in the range $0 \leq i \leq r$, the threshold query
$t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns $\block$, and that for all $i \geq
r+1$, the threshold query $t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$.

For the former, since the $x+1+r$th method execution on $j$ is the
first one that updates its state to $s^{x+1+r}_j \geq s'_a$, we have
by Definition~\ref{def:cvrdt-with-threshold-queries} that for all $i$
in the range $0 \leq i \leq r$, the threshold query
$t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns $\block$.

For the latter, since $s^{x+1+r}_j \geq s'_a$, by
Definition~\ref{def:cvrdt-with-threshold-queries} we have that
$t^{x+1+r+1}_j(\mathcal{S})$ returns $S_a$, and by
part~\ref{thm:this-replica} of the theorem, we have that for $i \geq
r+1$, subsequent executions $t^{x+1+i}_j(\mathcal{S})$ at replica $j$
will also return $S_a$, and so the case holds.
\end{itemize}

\item $s^k_i \nleq s^x_j$ and $s^x_j \nleq s^k_i$.
(That is, replica $i$'s state after the $k$th method execution on $i$
is \emph{not comparable} to replica $j$'s state after the $x$th method
execution on $j$.)  Similar to the previous case.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
