\begin{proof}
  \TODO{This should mention permutations.}

  We proceed by induction on $m$.  In the base case of $m = 1$, the
  result is immediate from
  Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-strong-local-confluence}.

  For the induction step, suppose $\conf \parstepsto^m \conf''
  \parstepsto \conf'''$ and suppose the lemma holds for $m$.

  We show that it holds for $m + 1$, as follows.

  We are required to show that there exist $\conf_c, i, j$ such that
  $\conf' \parstepsto^{i} \conf_c$ and $\conf''' \parstepsto^{j}
  \conf_c$ and $i \leq m + 1$ and $j \leq 1$.

  From the induction hypothesis, we have that there exist $\conf_c',
  i', j'$ such that $\conf' \parstepsto^{i'} \conf_c'$ and $\conf''
  \parstepsto^{j'} \conf_c'$ and $i' \leq m$ and $j' \leq 1$.

  We proceed by cases on $j'$:
  \begin{itemize}

  \item If $j' = 0$, then $\conf'' = \conf_c'$.  We can then
    choose $\conf_c = \conf'''$ and $i = i' + 1$ and $j = 0$.
    
  \item If $j' = 1$: From $\conf'' \parstepsto \conf'''$ and $\conf''
    \parstepsto^{j'} \conf_c'$ and
    Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-strong-local-confluence}, we have that there
    exist $\conf_c''$ and $i''$ and $j''$ such that $\conf'_c
    \parstepsto^{i''} \conf_c''$ and $\conf''' \parstepsto^{j''}
    \conf_c''$ and $i'' \leq 1$ and $j'' \leq 1$.

    So we also have $\conf' \parstepsto^{i'} \conf_c'
    \parstepsto^{i''} \conf_c''$.  In summary, we pick $\conf_c =
    \conf_c''$ and $i = i' + i''$ and $j = j''$, which is sufficient
    because $i = i' + i'' \leq m + 1$ and $j = j'' \leq 1$.
  \end{itemize}
