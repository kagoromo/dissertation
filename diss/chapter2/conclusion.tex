\section{Conclusion}\label{s:lvars-conclusion}

\TODO{Figure out if I should even have a conclusion, and if it should
  talk about the relationship to the next chapter.}

As single-assignment languages and Kahn process networks demonstrate,
monotonicity serves as the foundation of deterministic parallelism.
Taking monotonicity as a starting point, the LVars model generalizes
single assignment to monotonic multiple assignment parameterized by a
user-specified lattice.  Combining monotonic writes with threshold
reads yields a provably deterministic shared-state parallel
programming model that generalizes and unifies a class of languages
suitable for asynchronous parallel applications.
