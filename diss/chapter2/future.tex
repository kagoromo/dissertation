\section{Conclusion}

% In this paper, we introduced the $\lambdapar$, proved determinism, and
% pointed the way to some extensions.

As single-assignment languages and Kahn process networks demonstrate,
monotonicity serves as the foundation of deterministic parallelism.
Taking monotonicity as a starting point, our work generalizes single
assignment to monotonic multiple assignment parameterized by a
user-specified lattice.  By combining monotonic writes with threshold
reads, we get a shared-state parallel programming model that
generalizes and unifies an entire class of monotonic languages
suitable for asynchronous, data-driven applications.  Our model is
provably deterministic, and further provides a foundation for
exploration of limited nondeterminism.  Future work will improve upon
our prototype implementation, formally establish the relationship between
LVars and other deterministic parallel models,
investigate consistent termination for $\lambdapar$,
and prove the
limited nondeterminism property of $\lambdapar$ extended with $\CONSUME$.
