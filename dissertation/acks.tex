Not long ago, someone asked me if knew I wanted to work on LVars at the time I applied to grad school, and I had to laugh.  Not only did I not know that I wanted to work on LVars, I didn't even know what subfield of computer science I wanted to study.  I had an idea of what kinds of problems I thought were interesting, but I didn't really grasp that there was actually a field of study devoted to those problems and that "programming languages" was what it was called.  As it happened, one of the schools I applied to turned out to be a very good place to study PL; it also so happened that that school was the only one that accepted me.  So the first acknowledgement I want to make here is to the Indiana University computer science program for taking a chance on me and making this dissertation possible.

I took Dan Friedman's programming languages course in my first semester at IU in fall 2008, and the following spring, Dan invited me to be a teaching assistant for the undergraduate edition of the course, known as C311, together with his student and collaborator Will Byrd.  This inevitably led to my first PL research experience, which consisted of playing with an amazing little language called miniKanren\footnote{\url{http://www.minikanren.org} --- not that any such website existed at the time!} during the summer of 2009 with Dan, Will, and a group of relational programming aficionados fueled by intense curiosity and Mother Bear's pizza.  I was in no way prepared to do research and was in way over my head, but we had a lot of fun, and I went on to help out with C311 for two more semesters under Dan and Will's expert guidance.

Amal Ahmed joined the IU faculty in 2009 and was a tremendous influence on me as I began truly learning how to read research papers and, eventually, write them.  Although Amal and I never worked on determinism as such, it was nevertheless from Amal that I learned how to design and prove properties of calculi much like the $\lambdaLVar$ and $\lambdaLVish$ calculi in this dissertation.  Amal also had a huge influence on the culture of the PL group at IU.  Weekly ``PL Wonks'' meetings are a given these days, but it wasn't so very long ago that the PL group didn't have regular meetings or even much of a group identity.  It was Amal who rounded us all up and told us that from then on, we were all to give talks every semester.  It was also at Amal's urging that I attended my first PL conference, ICFP 2010 in Baltimore, where I first met an astonishing number of the people who have since become my mentors, colleagues, and dear friends in the PL community, including Neel Krishnaswami, Chung-chieh Shan, Tim Chevalier, Rob Simmons, Jason Reed, Ron Garcia, Stevie Strickland, Dan Licata, and Chris Martens.

When Amal left IU for Northeastern in 2011, I had to make the difficult decision between going with her or staying, and although I chose to stay at IU and work with Ryan Newton on what would eventually become this dissertation, I think that Amal's influence on the flavor of the work I ended up doing is evident.  (In fact, it was Amal who originally pointed out the similarity between the Independence Lemma and the frame rule that I discuss in Section~\ref{subsection:lvars-independence}.)

Ryan Newton, my advisor, runs at a faster clock speed than most people.  His first act as a new faculty member at Indiana in fall 2011 was to arrange for our department to get a fancy espresso machine --- and to kick-start a community of student espresso enthusiasts who lovingly maintain it.  In fact, now that I think about it, I'm not sure it was a coincidence that Ryan had the espresso machine installed in the kitchen directly next to my office...  Anyway, I took Ryan's seminar course that fall, which was how I started learning about deterministic parallel programming models.  In November 2011, we started enthusiastically discussing the idea of generalizing single-assignment models --- I remember getting so caught up in it one day that I made Ryan late for lunch with our visiting colloquium speaker, Bjarne Stroustrup --- and Ryan suggested that I could help him write a grant proposal to continue working on the idea.  We somehow managed to get our proposal together as 2011 came to a close, and to my astonishment, the proposal was funded.  I gratefully acknowledge everyone at the National Science Foundation who was involved in the decision to fund grant CCF-1218375, since without that early vote of confidence, I'm not sure I would have been able to keep my spirits up during the year that followed, in which it took us four attempts to get our first LVars paper published.  (And, although I didn't feel thankful at the time, I now understand that we owe a debt to the anonymous reviewers of POPL 2013, ESOP 2013, and ICFP 2013, whose constructive criticism helped us turn LVars from a half-baked idea into a convincing research contribution.)

In addition to Ryan, I was lucky to have a wonderful dissertation committee consisting of Amr Sabry, Larry Moss, and Chung-chieh Shan.  Amr, Larry, and Ken all played an important part early in the development of LVars and helped resolve subtle issues with the semantics of $\lambdaLVar$ and its determinism proof.  What appears now in Chapter~\ref{ch:lvars} is relatively simple---but it is only simple because of considerable effort on their parts!  I'm also grateful to all my committee members for showing up to my thesis proposal at eight-thirty in the morning in the middle of a snowstorm.  Additionally, I want to give special thanks to Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Neel Krishnaswami, and Aaron Turon---all of whom gave me so much guidance, encouragement, and support over the course of this project that I think of them as honorary committee members.

By fall 2012, working on LVars had gotten me interested in the idea of developing a separation logic for deterministic parallelism.  I reached out to Aaron and Neel, and they were enthusiastic about collaborating with Ryan and me.  When I met up with them in Saarbr{\"u}cken in January 2013, though, they suggested that we first focus on making the LVars programming model more expressive, and we put the separation logic idea on hold while we went on an exciting side trip into language design.  That so-called ``side trip'' eventually took us all the way to event handlers, quiescence, freezing, and quasi-determinism, the topics of Chapter~\ref{ch:quasi}, and to our POPL 2014 paper.  It also led to the LVish Haskell library, the topic of Chapter~\ref{ch:lvish}, which was largely implemented by Aaron and Ryan.  The proof of quasi-determinism for $\lambdaLVish$ was done in collaboration with Neel.  I'm thankful also to Derek Dreyer for helping facilitate our collaboration, as well as for giving me an excuse to give a \emph{Big Lebowski}-themed talk at MPI-SWS.

One of the most exciting and rewarding parts of my dissertation work has been pursuing the connection between LVars and distributed data consistency --- the topic of Chapter~\ref{ch:distributed}.  It's often a challenge for people coming from different subfields to find common ground, and I'm indebted to the many distributed systems researchers and practitioners who have met me more than halfway, particularly the BOOM group at Berkeley and the Riak folks at Basho.  Speaking  at RICON 2013 about LVars was one of the highlights of my Ph.D. experience; thanks to everyone who made it so.

Jason Reed contributed the wonderful spot illustrations that appear throughout this dissertation.  My hope is that they'll make the pages a bit more inviting and offer some comic relief.

Finally, this dissertation is dedicated to my wonderful partner, Alex Rudnick, without whose unflagging love, support, advice, and encouragement I doubt I would have \emph{started} grad school, let alone finished.
