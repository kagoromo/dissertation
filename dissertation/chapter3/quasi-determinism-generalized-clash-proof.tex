\begin{proof}
  Consider arbitrary $U_S$ such that $U_S$ is non-conflicting with
  $\config{S}{e} \parstepsto \config{S'}{e'}$ and $U_S(S') = \topS$
  and and $U_S$ is freeze-safe with $\config{S}{e} \parstepsto
  \config{S'}{e'}$.

  To show: $\config{U_S(S)}{e} \parstepsto \error$.

  The proof is by cases on the rule of the reduction semantics by
  which $\config{S}{e}$ steps to $\config{S'}{e'}$.  Since
  $\config{S'}{e'} \neq \error$, we do not need to consider the {\sc
    E-Put-Err} rule.  The assumption that $U_S$ is freeze-safe with
  $\config{S}{e} \parstepsto \config{S'}{e'}$ is only needed in the
  {\sc E-Freeze-Final} and {\sc E-Freeze-Simple} cases.
