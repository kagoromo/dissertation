\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $\conf \ctxstepsto^n \conf'$ and $\conf \ctxstepsto^m
  \conf''$, where $1 \leq n$ and $1 \leq m$.

  We have to show that there exist $\conf_c, i, j, \pi$ such that
  $\conf' \ctxstepsto^i \conf_c$ and $\pi(\conf'') \ctxstepsto^j
  \conf_c$ and $i \leq m$ and $j \leq n$.

  We proceed by induction on $n$.

  In the base case of $n = 1$, the result is immediate from
  Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-strong-one-sided-confluence}.

  For the induction step, suppose $\conf \ctxstepsto^n \conf'
  \ctxstepsto \conf'''$ and suppose the lemma holds for $n$.

  We show that it holds for $n + 1$, as follows.

  We are required to show that there exist $\conf_c, i, j, \pi$ such
  that $\conf''' \ctxstepsto^i \conf_c$ and $\pi(\conf'')
  \ctxstepsto^j \conf_c$ and $i \leq m$ and $j \leq n + 1$.

  From the induction hypothesis, there exist $\conf'_c, i', j', \pi'$
  such that $\conf' \ctxstepsto^{i'} \conf'_c$ and $\pi'(\conf'')
  \ctxstepsto^{j'} \conf'_c$ and $i' \leq m$ and $j' \leq n$.

  We proceed by cases on $i'$:
  \begin{itemize}

  \item If $i' = 0$, then $\conf' = \conf_c'$.

    We can then choose $\conf_c = \conf'''$ and $i = 0$ and $j = j' +
    1$ and $\pi = \pi'$.

    Since $\pi'(\conf'') \ctxstepsto^{j'} \conf'_c \ctxstepsto
    \conf'''$, and $j' + 1 \leq n + 1$ since $j' \leq n$, the case is
    satisfied.

  \item If $i' \geq 1$:

    From $\conf' \ctxstepsto \conf'''$ and $\conf' \ctxstepsto^{i'}
    \conf_c'$ and Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-strong-one-sided-confluence},
    we have that there exist $\conf_c''$ and $i''$ and $j''$ and
    $\pi''$ such that $\conf''' \ctxstepsto^{i''} \conf_c''$ and
    $\pi''(\conf_c') \ctxstepsto^{j''} \conf_c''$ and $i'' \leq i'$
    and $j'' \leq 1$.

    Since $\pi'(\conf'') \ctxstepsto^{j'} \conf'_c$, by
    Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-permutability} (Permutability) we have that
    $\pi''(\pi'(\conf'')) \ctxstepsto^{j'} \pi''(\conf'_c)$.

    So we also have $\pi''(\pi'(\conf'')) \ctxstepsto^{j'}
    \pi''(\conf'_c) \ctxstepsto^{j''} \conf_c''$.

    In summary, we pick $\conf_c = \conf_c''$ and $i = i''$ and $j =
    j' + j''$ and $\pi = \pi' \circ \pi''$, which is sufficient
    because $i = i'' \leq i' \leq m$ and $j = j' + j'' \leq n + 1$.
  \end{itemize}
