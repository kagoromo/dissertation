\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\config{S}{\evalctxt{E_1}{e_1}} \ctxstepsto \config{S_1}{\evalctxt{E_1}{e'_1}}$ and
  $\config{S}{\evalctxt{E_2}{e_2}} \ctxstepsto
  \config{S_2}{\evalctxt{E_2}{e'_2}}$ and $\evalctxt{E_1}{e_1} =
  \evalctxt{E_2}{e_2}$.

  We are required to show that if $E_1 \neq E_2$, then there exist
  evaluation contexts $E'_1$ and $E'_2$ such that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\evalctxt{E'_1}{e_1} = \evalctxt{E_2}{e'_2}$, and
  \item $\evalctxt{E'_2}{e_2} = \evalctxt{E_1}{e'_1}$, and
  \item $\evalctxt{E'_1}{e'_1} = \evalctxt{E'_2}{e'_2}$.
  \end{itemize}

  The proof is by induction on the structure of the expression $e$.
  Proceeding by cases:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Case $x$: In this case, the only possible context for $E_1$
      and $E_2$ is the empty context $[~]$.  Therefore $E_1 = E_2$,
      and so the case holds vacuously.

    \item Case $v$: Similar to the case for $x$.

    \item Case $\app{e_a}{e_b}$:

      If $E_1 = E_2$, the case holds vacuously.  Otherwise, we proceed
      as follows.  We know that $\app{e_a}{e_b} =
      \evalctxt{E_1}{e_1}$.  From the grammar of evaluation contexts,
      then, we know that either:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $\app{e_a}{e_b} = \evalctxt{E_1}{e_1} = \app{\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e_1}}{e_b}$, where $\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e_1} = e_a$, or
        \item $\app{e_a}{e_b} = \evalctxt{E_1}{e_1} = \app{e_a}{\evalctxt{E_{12}}{e_1}}$, where $\evalctxt{E_{12}}{e_1} = e_b$.
      \end{itemize}

      Similarly, we know that $\app{e_a}{e_b} = \evalctxt{E_2}{e_2}$.  From the grammar of
      evaluation contexts, we know that either:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $\app{e_a}{e_b} = \evalctxt{E_2}{e_2} = \app{\evalctxt{E_{21}}{e_2}}{e_b}$, where $\evalctxt{E_{21}}{e_2} = e_a$, or
        \item $\app{e_a}{e_b} = \evalctxt{E_2}{e_2} = \app{e_a}{\evalctxt{E_{22}}{e_2}}$, where $\evalctxt{E_{22}}{e_2} = e_b$.
      \end{itemize}

      This gives us four cases to consider:

      \begin{itemize}
        \item $\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e_1} = e_a$ and
          $\evalctxt{E_{21}}{e_2} = e_a$:

          In this case, we know that $E_{11} \neq E_{21}$, because if
          $E_{11} = E_{21}$, we would have $e_1 = e_2$, which would
          mean that $E_1 = E_2$, a contradiction.  So, since $E_{11}
          \neq E_{21}$, by IH we have that there exist evaluation
          contexts $E'_{11}$ and $E'_{21}$ such that:
          \begin{itemize}
          \item $\evalctxt{E'_{11}}{e_1} = \evalctxt{E_{21}}{e'_2}$, and
          \item $\evalctxt{E'_{21}}{e_2} = \evalctxt{E_{11}}{e'_1}$, and
          \item $\evalctxt{E'_{11}}{e'_1} = \evalctxt{E'_{21}}{e'_2}$.
          \end{itemize}

          Hence we can choose $E'_1 =
          \app{E'_{11}}{e_b}$ and $E'_2 =
          \app{E'_{21}}{e_b}$, which satisfy the
          criteria for $E'_1$ and $E'_2$.

          \lk{These work because: $\evalctxt{E'_1}{e_1} =
            \app{\evalctxt{E'_{11}}{e_1}}{e_b}$, which is equal to
            $\app{\evalctxt{E_{21}}{e'_2}}{e_b}$, which is equal to
            $\evalctxt{E_2}{e'_2}$.  Also, $\evalctxt{E'_2}{e_2} =
            \app{\evalctxt{E'_{21}}{e_2}}{e_b}$, which is equal to
            $\app{\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e'_1}}{e_b}$, which is equal to
            $\evalctxt{E_1}{e'_1}$.  And finally,
            $\evalctxt{E'_1}{e'_1} =
            \app{\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e'_1}}{e_b}$, which is the same as
            $\app{\evalctxt{E'_{21}}{e'_2}}{e_b}$, which is the same
            as $\evalctxt{E'_2}{e'_2}$.}

        \item $\evalctxt{E_{12}}{e_1} = e_b$ and
          $\evalctxt{E_{22}}{e_2} = e_b$: Similar to the previous
          case.
          
        \item $\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e_1} = e_a$ and
          $\evalctxt{E_{22}}{e_2} = e_b$:

          In this case, we can choose $E'_1 =
          \app{E_{11}}{\evalctxt{E_{22}}{e'_2}}$, and $E'_2 =
          \app{\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e'_1}}{E_{22}}$, which satisfy the
          criteria for $E'_1$ and $E'_2$.

          \lk{These work because: $\evalctxt{E'_1}{e_1} =
            \app{\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e_1}}{\evalctxt{E_{22}}{e'_2}}$,
            which is the same as $\app{e_a}{\evalctxt{E_{22}}{e'_2}}$,
            which is the same as $\evalctxt{E_2}{e'_2}$.  Also,
            $\evalctxt{E'_2}{e_2} =
            \app{\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e'_1}}{\evalctxt{E_{22}}{e_2}}$,
            which is the same as $\app{\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e'_1}}{e_b}$,
            which is the same as $\evalctxt{E_1}{e'_1}$.  And finally,
            $\evalctxt{E'_1}{e'_1} =
            \app{\evalctxt{E_{11}}{e'_1}}{\evalctxt{E_{22}}{e'_2}}$,
            which is the same as $\evalctxt{E'_2}{e'_2}$.}

        \item $\evalctxt{E_{12}}{e_1} = e_b$ and
          $\evalctxt{E_{21}}{e_2} = e_a$: Similar to the previous
          case.
      \end{itemize}

    \item Case $\getexp{e_a}{e_b}$: Similar to the case for $\app{e_a}{e_b}$.

    \item Case $\putexp{e_a}{e_b}$: Similar to the case for $\app{e_a}{e_b}$.

    \item Case $\NEW$: Similar to the case for $x$.
  \end{itemize}
