\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\conf \ctxstepsto \conf'$ and $\conf \ctxstepsto^m
  \conf''$, where $1 \leq m$.  We have to show that there exist
  $\conf_c, i, j, \pi$ such that $\conf' \ctxstepsto^i \conf_c$ and
  $\pi(\conf'') \ctxstepsto^j \conf_c$ and $i \leq m$ and $j \leq 1$.

  We proceed by induction on $m$.  In the base case of $m = 1$, the
  result is immediate from
  Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-strong-local-confluence}.

  For the induction step, suppose $\conf \ctxstepsto^m \conf''
  \ctxstepsto \conf'''$ and suppose the lemma holds for $m$.

  We show that it holds for $m + 1$, as follows.

  We are required to show that there exist $\conf_c, i, j, \pi$ such
  that $\conf' \ctxstepsto^{i} \conf_c$ and $\pi(\conf''')
  \ctxstepsto^{j} \conf_c$ and $i \leq m + 1$ and $j \leq 1$.

  From the induction hypothesis, we have that there exist $\conf_c',
  i', j', \pi'$ such that $\conf' \ctxstepsto^{i'} \conf_c'$ and
  $\pi'(\conf'') \ctxstepsto^{j'} \conf_c'$ and $i' \leq m$ and $j'
  \leq 1$.

  We proceed by cases on $j'$:
  \begin{itemize}

  \item If $j' = 0$, then $\pi'(\conf'') = \conf_c'$.

    Since $\conf'' \ctxstepsto \conf'''$, we have that $\pi'(\conf'')
    \ctxstepsto \pi'(\conf''')$ by
    Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-permutability} (Permutability).

    We can then choose $\conf_c = \pi'(\conf''')$ and $i = i' + 1$ and
    $j = 0$ and $\pi = \pi'$.  The key is that $\conf'
    \ctxstepsto^{i'} \conf'_c = \pi'(\conf'') \ctxstepsto
    \pi'(\conf''')$ for a total of $i' + 1$ steps.
    
  \item If $j' = 1$:

    First, since $\pi'(\conf'') \ctxstepsto^{j'} \conf'_c$, then by
    Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-permutability} (Permutability) we have that
    $\conf'' \ctxstepsto^{j'} \piprimeinv(\conf'_c)$.

    Then, by $\conf'' \ctxstepsto^{j'} \piprimeinv(\conf'_c)$ and
    $\conf'' \ctxstepsto \conf'''$ and
    Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-strong-local-confluence} (Strong Local
    Confluence), we have that there exist $\conf_c''$ and $i''$ and
    $j''$ and $\pi''$ such that $\piprimeinv(\conf'_c)
    \ctxstepsto^{i''} \conf_c''$ and $\pi''(\conf''')
    \ctxstepsto^{j''} \conf_c''$ and $i'' \leq 1$ and $j'' \leq 1$.

    Since $\piprimeinv(\conf'_c) \ctxstepsto^{i''} \conf_c''$, by
    Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-permutability} (Permutability) we have that
    $\conf'_c \ctxstepsto^{i''} \pi'(\conf_c'')$.

    So we also have $\conf' \ctxstepsto^{i'} \conf_c'
    \ctxstepsto^{i''} \pi'(\conf_c'')$.

    Since $\pi''(\conf''') \ctxstepsto^{j''} \conf_c''$, by
    Lemma~\ref{lem:lvars-permutability} (Permutability) we have that
    $\pi'(\pi''(\conf''')) \ctxstepsto^{j''} \pi'(\conf_c'')$.

    In summary, we pick $\conf_c = \pi'(\conf_c'')$ and $i = i' + i''$
    and $j = j''$ and $\pi = \pi'' \circ \pi'$, which is sufficient
    because $i = i' + i'' \leq m + 1$ and $j = j'' \leq 1$.
  \end{itemize}
