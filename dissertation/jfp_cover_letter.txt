Dear editors,

Please find attached our manuscript, "LVars: lattice-based data
structures for deterministic parallel programming", which we are
submitting for consideration for the upcoming JFP Special Issue on
Parallel and Concurrent Programming.

This manuscript can be thought of as a significantly revised and
extended version of our POPL 2014 paper "Freeze after writing:
quasi-deterministic parallel programming with LVars".  It incorporates
previously unpublished material, as well as some material from our
other publications on LVars.

Thanks for your consideration of our manuscript, and special thanks to
Matthias Felleisen for encouraging us to submit our work to JFP.

Best,
Lindsey Kuper, Aaron Turon, Neel Krishnaswami, and Ryan Newton
