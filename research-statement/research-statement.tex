\title{Research Statement}

\maketitle

\lk{Some of this wording is borrowed from Aaron Turon's research statement.}

The goal of my research is to create tools, techniques, and
abstractions that support \emph{compositional reasoning} about
programs, proofs, and processes, especially those that do not
immediately appear to compose well.  To this end, I study programming
languages, and for the last few years my focus has been on parallel
and distributed programming models.  Below I discuss my work in more
detail, beginning in \S\ref{lvars} with my work on LVars,
lattice-based data structures for deterministic parallelism and
continuing in \S\ref{quasi} with a discussion of quasi-deterministic
parallelism.  Then in \S\ref{crdts}, I discuss the relationship
between LVars and CRDTs.  For brevity, I do not discuss my previous
work on \emph{relational programming}~\cite{lambdae},
\emph{multi-language parametricity}~\cite{multilang-talk}, or
\emph{verifying CPU semantics}~\cite{tsl-tr}.
